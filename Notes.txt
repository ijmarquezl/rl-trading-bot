7/17/24 - First time running with checkpoints implemented for resume training.
This code implements a reinforcement learning (RL) based trading bot using an Actor-Critic architecture. It's a good starting point for building an autonomous trading system, but there are several areas for improvement and potential issues to address.

Clear Structure: The code is well-organized with a CustomEnv class encapsulating the trading environment and separate functions for training, testing, and random games.
Actor-Critic Model: The choice of Actor-Critic is suitable for continuous action spaces and can learn both policy (Actor) and value (Critic) functions.
Technical Indicators: The inclusion of MACD, signal line, and RSI indicators provides valuable market context for decision-making.
TensorBoard Integration: Using TensorBoard allows for effective monitoring of training progress and loss visualization.
Checkpointing: The checkpoint_interval parameter enables saving model progress during training, which is crucial for long training runs.
State Representation: The current state representation combines market history and order history. Consider exploring more sophisticated state representations that capture additional market dynamics, such as order book data, news sentiment, or social media trends.
Reward Function: The reward function is simply the difference in net worth. This might lead to short-term profit maximization without considering risk or long-term portfolio growth. Explore more comprehensive reward functions that incorporate risk measures (e.g., Sharpe ratio, drawdown) and encourage long-term profitability.
Action Space: The action space is limited to hold, buy, or sell with 100% allocation. A more realistic approach would involve a continuous action space representing the percentage of the portfolio to allocate to each action.
Hyperparameter Tuning: The learning rate, epochs, and other hyperparameters are fixed. Experiment with different values and optimization techniques (e.g., grid search, Bayesian optimization) to find optimal settings.
Overfitting: The model might overfit to the training data. Implement regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization) and consider using a validation set to monitor generalization performance.
Transaction Costs: The current implementation doesn't account for transaction costs, which can significantly impact profitability in real-world trading.
Market Dynamics: The environment assumes a random price between open and close for each step. Real markets exhibit more

To execute real operations on today's data using the code you provided, you would need to make the following modifications:

* Remove the line df = yf.download("BTC-USD", start="2022-06-01", end=date.today()) as it is currently downloading historical data. Instead, you would need to fetch the current data for the asset you are interested in.
* Update the CustomEnv class to fetch real-time data instead of using the historical data. You can use an API like Alpha Vantage or CoinGecko to fetch the current data for the asset.
* Modify the step method in the CustomEnv class to execute real trades based on the current price and other indicators. You can use the action parameter to determine whether to buy, sell, or hold.
* Implement a trading strategy within the step method to determine the appropriate actions to take based on the current market conditions.
* Add code to handle the execution of trades. This could involve using an exchange API to place orders and manage the position.
* Implement a mechanism to monitor the performance of the trading bot and adjust the strategy if necessary.
Here's an example of how you can modify the step method in the CustomEnv class to execute real trades:

def step(self, action):
    # Fetch the current price and other indicators
    current_price = fetch_current_price()
    macd = fetch_macd()
    signal = fetch_signal_line()
    rsi = fetch_rsi()

    # Execute trades based on the action and indicators
    if action == 0:  # Hold
        pass

    elif action == 1 and self.balance > 0:
        # Buy with 100% of current balance
        self.crypto_bought = self.balance / current_price
        self.balance -= self.crypto_bought * current_price
        self.crypto_held += self.crypto_bought
        execute_buy_order(self.crypto_bought, current_price)

    elif action == 2 and self.crypto_held > 0:
        # Sell all held crypto
        self.crypto_sold = self.crypto_held
        self.balance += self.crypto_sold * current_price
        self.crypto_held -= self.crypto_sold
        execute_sell_order(self.crypto_sold, current_price)

    # Update the state and return the observation
    self.market_history.append([current_price, macd, signal, rsi])
    state = np.concatenate((self.market_history, self.orders_history), axis=1)
    obs = state
    return obs
Note that this is just a basic example, and you would need to implement the fetch_current_price, fetch_macd, fetch_signal_line, fetch_rsi, execute_buy_order, and execute_sell_order functions based on your specific trading strategy and exchange API.
